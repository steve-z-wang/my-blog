                    <p>Hey, I'm Steve — a software engineer by day, and a curious human the rest of the time.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently working at Amazon, learning a lot about building scalable systems and diving deeper into AI and data infrastructure. I started this blog to share what I'm learning, reflect on ideas, and keep track of the things that interest me — from tech to books to random thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I love being outdoors — rock climbing, hiking, or just soaking in some nature. I'm always up for a good book, a new challenge, or an excuse to learn something unexpected.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for stopping by — hope you find something here that sparks a thought or two.</p>
