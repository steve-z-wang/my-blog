## Why I'm Starting This Blog

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time.

In essence, I'm just a very expressive person. Whenever I have an idea, I get excited to share it with friends. After I quit instagram last year, that urge become even stronger. 

I find feel joy when I can influence my friends or help them seeing thing from another perspectives. 

Instead of texting my friends for hours (sorry if you're reading this), 

I figured maybe it's time to put those thoughts somewhere that makes more sense. 

But beyond that, I have a few other reasons for starting this blog: 

### 1. Writing Helps Me Learn

I listened to this audiobook called*Make it stick*. A key takeaway from that book is this: **retrieval strengthens memory** When you try to recall something without looking it up. you reinforce neural connections and deepen understanding. 

Writing is a form of retrieval. When I sit down to explain what I an idea in my own words, I'm not just recalling-it's like compressing raw information into a more structured, personal format. This processes helps me truly own what I've learned. 

I've found that if I consume too much information without reflection or organizing it, it all becomes **noise**. But when I take time to write things down--to map out connections between ideas--I retain more, and I see things more clearly. 

### 2. Writing Organizes My Thoughts

Somethings I have so many ideas racing through my head that it's hard to focus. I'll lie in bed thinking, unable to sleep, because I'm thinking about five things at once. Starting a daily note habit helped a lot, just dumping thoughts out, no structure, just to offload them.

And writing for this blog is one step further, not only it will help me to offload mental clutter, but also to put them into structure. It’s like cleaning up a messy room—you finally see what’s there and where everything belongs. 

Having less thought in my head helps me focus. When your brain is too full, it’s hard to concentrate or build on what you know. Writing helps make space. Just like using ChatGPT or other LLMs, you want to make sure that the context windows is clean. 

### 3. Writing Creates Leverage

Another reason I started this blog is leverage. Sharing an idea in person might take hours—but writing it once and sharing it online takes the same effort, and can reach far more people. 

In long term, It’s also a form of personal branding could grow over time. 
### 4. Writing Helps Me Connect

i’m hoping this blog helps me connect with people who think about similar things, or even totally different things, I love learning new perspective.

## What You Can Expect Here


So what will I be writing about?

### 1. Technology

I’ll share what I’m learning through coding projects and writing summaries to help solidify the knowledge.

### 2. Book Summaries

I listen to a lot of audiobooks and read regularly. This blog will be a place to distill key takeaways.

### 3. Thoughts on Various Topics

I hope writing regularly will encourage me to think more independently and generate new ideas.

### 4. Prose & Poems

Sometimes I just enjoy writing prose or poetry to express a feeling or moment.


We'll see.
