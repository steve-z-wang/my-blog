I’ve wanted to start a blog; it’s been a while.

## A Need to Express

Reflecting back, I think I’ve always had a need to express myself—to create, to share, and to anticipate how others would respond.

I used to love photography. I bought my first camera in high school and continued taking photos until the end of graduate school. I’m far from a professional, but I consider myself a good amateur—someone who can connect abstract, intuitive, and emotional thinking to create unique work. I loved sharing my photos with friends, and I was always enthusiastic about explaining the meaning and story behind each piece. I also posted some on social media.

In high school, there was also a time when I fell in love with writing prose. I wrote a few short pieces that, even when I reread them today, surprise me—they seem beyond what I thought a high schooler could write. I remember texting my best friends to ask for feedback. Their approval encouraged me to write more.

In my last year of college, I took a poetry writing class—something not many computer science students would probably do. Though my work wasn’t great (some pieces were awkward), I _loved_ the open sessions where I could read my poems aloud and receive feedback.

These days, I don’t take photos or write prose anymore—sometimes I’ll write a short piece when I _absolutely_ have to (usually when I’m feeling sentimental).

Instead, like many of my peers in tech, my mind is filled with topics like self-improvement, AI, business opportunities, and growth, all tinged with a fear of missing out. It’s a constant anxiety. I often bombard my friends with long message after long message full of random thoughts (sorry if you’re reading this). So I figured it would probably be a better use of time to write things down.

Beyond just being an outlet for thoughts, here are some other valid reasons why I’m starting this blog—reasons I believe are beneficial in the long run.

## Other Benefits

### 1. To Learn Better

I listened to an audiobook called _Make It Stick_. One key takeaway is this: **retrieval strengthens memory**. When you try to recall something without looking it up, you reinforce neural connections and deepen your understanding.

Writing is a form of retrieval. When I sit down to explain an idea in my own words, I’m not just recalling it—I’m compressing raw information into a structured, personal format. That process helps me truly internalize what I’ve learned.

I’ve found that if I consume too much information without reflecting or organizing it, it all turns into noise. But when I take time to write—mapping out connections between ideas—I retain more and understand better.

Sometimes I think of humans as being like LLMs (large language models). To train an LLM well, you feed it data and update its parameters based on the output. I think people work the same way: we read and learn, but we also need to produce something in response. That output becomes feedback—it helps train our brains to think more clearly and effectively.

### 2. To Organize My Thoughts and Stay Focused

Like I said earlier, I often have so many thoughts racing through my head that I can’t focus—thinking about five things at once. This year, I started a daily note-taking habit, which helped. I would just dump my thoughts with no structure, just to offload them.

This blog is a step further. It not only helps me offload mental clutter—it helps organize it. It’s like cleaning a messy room: you finally see what’s there and where everything belongs.

Having fewer unorganized thoughts in my head helps me focus. Think of how an LLM needs a clean context window to function well. Likewise, when your brain is overloaded, it’s hard to concentrate or build on what you already know. Writing clears that space.

### 3. To Stay Motivated by Showing My Work

As I mentioned earlier, I’ve always enjoyed sharing my work with others. It motivates me to keep learning and creating.

It also makes me take my work more seriously. When you know others will see what you create, you feel more accountable for it. It becomes part of your personal brand.

### 4. To Build Leverage

Another reason I’m starting this blog is for leverage. Sharing an idea in person might take hours, but writing it once and posting it online takes about the same effort and can reach far more people.

In the long run, it also contributes to personal branding—something that compounds over time.

### 5. To Connect

I hope this blog helps me connect with people who think about similar things—or even people with different perspectives. I love learning how others see the world.

## What You Can Expect Here

So, what will I be blogging about?

### 1. Technology

I’ll share what I’m learning through coding projects and use this space to reflect and solidify my knowledge.

### 2. Book Summaries

I listen to a lot of audiobooks and read regularly. This blog will help me distill and share key takeaways.

### 3. Thoughts on Various Topics

I hope that writing regularly will encourage me to think more independently and develop new ideas.

We'll see.

Thanks for reading my first post. More to come soon.
